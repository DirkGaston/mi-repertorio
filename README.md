üéµ üéµ **My Repertoire** is a basic song management system that allows you to register a list of songs with their corresponding keys. üéµ üéµ

_This project was developed as the **Introduction to Express.js** assigment in the **Backend with Node and Express** course  for Desafio LATAM's **Full Stack with JavaScript** bootcamp_

## Assignment Background üìñ

The music school "E-Sue√±o" is motivating its singing students to perform live and has contacted the local restaurant to use its stage and start a calendar of presentations. In order to manage the songs their students will sing, the school hired a freelance developer to create a CRUD type application.

In this challenge you will have to develop an Express server that uses the File
System module to add, modify and delete songs stored in a local JSON named repertoire.json.

The server will need to make the following routes available:

‚óè POST /songs : Receives the data corresponding to a song and adds it to the
repertoire. <br>
‚óè GET /songs : Returns a JSON with the songs registered in the repertoire. <br>
‚óè PUT /songs/:id : Receives the data of a song to be edited and updates it by manipulating the JSON. <br>
‚óè DELETE /songs/:id : Receives the id of a song by queryString and deletes it from the
repertoire. <br>
